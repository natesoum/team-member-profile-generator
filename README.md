  ## Description

  What kept me motivated for this project was my curiousity on test development & classes. I needed to apply what I've learned to a project that needed both. This project was the perfect "sandbox" for me to practice both skils. It helped me get a better understanding of both, even though at this time, I feel that they are still very basic code. We all start from somewhere and I plan to learn even more from here!

  I built this project to test myself. Daily, I try to practice coding and hone on my skills. 

  This project solves any team that would love to put together a small website together to keep information for their team! 

  I learned a ton, test driven development & OOP had me confused for a long time. I spent a ton of time looking at my screen not knowing where to start but eventually I was able to put the pieces together and build this project that gave me a better understanding on JavaScript, Node & all things in between.
